# SiFT_Util
This is a sift util warping OpenCV's sift feature detector.
## Installation
[Python3.x](https://www.python.org/) and opencv-contrib-python package.
To install opencv with contrib modules, try:
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
Note that the packages are special wheel binary packages and they already contain statically built OpenCV binaries.
So you needn't install opencv-python.
